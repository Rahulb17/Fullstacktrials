The Modern Frame — Project Deliverables
Author: (Your Name)

Files included:
- index.html
- gallery.html
- about.html
- contact.html
- css/style.css
- images/ (contains no local images; HTML uses picsum.photos placeholders)
- videos/ (empty; embedded video uses an external iframe)

Implemented features:
- Fixed header with navigation linking all pages (relative paths).
- Semantic HTML5 structure: header, nav, main, section, article, footer, figure/figcaption.
- Gallery page uses CSS Grid (2x2). 
- About page includes unordered list (staff) and ordered list (exhibition timeline).
- Contact page includes a table for studio hours.
- External link with target="_blank" and rel="noopener" included on the home page.
- At least 4 images included via picsum.photos with alt attributes.
- Embedded video via iframe.
- CSS: external stylesheet, flexbox, grid, floats, box-sizing, fixed header, absolutely positioned badge, transitions, transform scale on hover.
- Uses named color, HEX, RGB, and HSL variables.
- @keyframes animation for blinking open-house banner.

Known issues:
- Images are referenced from picsum.photos (online). If you want local images, download them into the images/ folder and update paths.
- The layout is desktop-oriented (fixed-width) by design as requested.

Browsers tested: Project created in an offline environment. Recommend Chrome and Firefox for best results.
