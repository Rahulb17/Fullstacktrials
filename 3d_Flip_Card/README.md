Project: 3D Flip Card

Summary: An interactive card that rotates 180 degrees around the Y-axis on hover, achieved using only CSS transform and transition properties, demonstrating 3D space control.

Implemented Features:
- Card structure with distinct front and back faces.
- Use of transform-style: preserve-3d and perspective.
- backface-visibility: hidden to prevent faces from showing through.
- Smooth rotation (transition: 0.6s) using transform: rotateY(180deg) on hover.

Known Issues: None.
Browser Tested: Chrome, Firefox
