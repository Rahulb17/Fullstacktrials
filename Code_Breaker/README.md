Project: Code Breaker - The Array Heist

Summary: An interactive game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that teaches array manipulation concepts (insertion, deletion) and subarray pattern searching, with a visual array display.

Implemented Features:
- Visual display of a fixed-size (10 cell) numeric array.
- Core array operations: Insert at Index, Delete at Index, and Search for Pattern.
- JavaScript logic for array shifting (splice/push).
- Hidden secret pattern generation (3 digits).
- Subarray linear search logic with visual highlighting.
- Feedback system for success/error messages.

Known Issues: Basic animations for shifting elements are implemented using CSS transitions, but are simple and require refining for complex scenarios.
Browser Tested: Chrome, Firefox
